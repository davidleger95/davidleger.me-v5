## A bit about me.

Hey! My name is David and I'm a web developer living in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I graduated from the University of New Brunswick in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. I've been hacking away on web projects since about 2010. I love combining creativity with technical skills to design and build awesome things on the web. Check out some of my projects below!
