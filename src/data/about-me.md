## A bit about me.

My name id David and I'm a web developer wliving in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I graduated from the University of New Brunswick in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. I've been hacking away on web projects since 2010 and I love combining creativity with technical skills to design and build awesome things on the web. Here are the technologies and concepts I'm most interested in at the moment:

- Modern JavaScript & CSS
- Progressive web apps
- Web accessibility
- GraphQL/Apollo
- JAMStack
